# Mini Challenge 7 - Reverse It
# Project will take users input and print it back into the terminal in reverse. Data validation will say whether it's a number or word. Play again option available also.

# Peer Review: I really liked how organized and clean the output of the code looked. The validations were good and I had no issues with the code everything looks great. The only thing I would add is a clear at the beggining so it looks a little cleaner. good job!
